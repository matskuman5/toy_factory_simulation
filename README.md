A simple Java simulation of a toy factory. Component manufacturers produce parts and send packages of them to the factory, which then produces toys based on the amount of parts it has in stock. The simulation is ran hour by hour until the desired amount of toys is produced. Most variables relevant to the simulation can easily be adjusted in Config.java.
